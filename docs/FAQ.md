## How can I only map certain keywords?
The s9e Textformatter does not allow you to indicate which words should be mapped an which shouldn't be.
However, for your convenience, we have made it so, that keywords with an empty value are mapped to the same keyword automatically.

## How can I create different keyword templates?
This is unfortunately not possible.
The s9e Textformatter only allows for 'one group of keywords', and that one group uses one template.

## Can you help me create my keyword template?
This is unfortunately not possible.
It is not the intention of this extension.
The purpose is to allow you, the Administrator, to choose what you do with your board.
It is impossible for us to make a BBCode template for each and every request.
